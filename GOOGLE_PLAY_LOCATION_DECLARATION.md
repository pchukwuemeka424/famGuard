## Location Access
**Describe one location-based feature in your app that needs access to location in the background. (0/500 characters)**

```
FamGuard continuously shares the user's location with their trusted family connections in the background, even when the app is not actively open. This background location sharing enables family members to see each other's real-time location on a map, which is critical for safety and emergency response. When a user enables location sharing, their location is automatically updated and shared with their connections every hour, ensuring family members always have access to the most recent location information. This feature is essential for emergency situations where quick location access can be life-saving, such as when a family member sends an emergency alert or needs immediate assistance. The background location access ensures location data remains current even when users are not actively using the app.
